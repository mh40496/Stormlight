Stormlight Sphere Emulation

The purpose of this project is to emulate the currency/energy (Spheres) system of the high fantasy series of The Stormlight Archives.
Spheres function as a trade commodity with different denominations same as real life currencies, but instead with added functionality
and alternative values depending on the realm it is used in (Roshar/Shadesmar).
